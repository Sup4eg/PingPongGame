<p>
By default the starts 0 | 0 and it will be finished when some one (player, or AI) score 5 poings. If you want to change final score, use FINAL_SCORE constant. 
Also if you want to change AI hard mode use AI_HARD_COEFFICIENT, by default it is 1 (the hardest). If you want to change any others parameters of the game use constants at the beginning of the file.
